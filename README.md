# Frame-Window-Similarity-Scanner

This Streamlit web application allows users to upload and compare molecular interaction fingerprint datasets (CSV files) generated by [ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/). The app computes pairwise Tanimoto similarities between frames of two fingerprint datasets and identifies the optimal window of maximum similarity between them.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload multiple ProLIF-generated fingerprint CSVs via sidebar.
- ✅ Select any two files for comparison.
- 🧹 Automatically cleans and aligns fingerprint data based on shared interaction columns.
- 🧠 Computes full Tanimoto similarity matrix between all aligned frames.
- 🔍 Scans all possible window combinations of a given size and finds the one with the highest average similarity.
- 📊 Displays:
  - Full similarity heatmap with the optimal window highlighted.
  - Heatmap of the optimal similarity window.

## 📎 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
